About
======
I'm currently a second-year PhD candidate at Stanford University in Environment and Resources (E-IPER)! Additionally, I'm a [Knight-Hennessy Scholar](https://knight-hennessy.stanford.edu/people/leona-neftaliem) and National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow. I'm co-advised by Profs. [Chris Field](https://fieldlab.stanford.edu/) and [Rob Jackson](https://jacksonlab.stanford.edu/), and I'm also a member of Prof. [Nicole Ardoin's Social Ecology Lab](https://socialecology.stanford.edu/).

My Research
======
As we anticipate rapid urbanization globally under increasing climate instability, my dissertation aims to better understand and mitigate the social and ecological challenges
observed in cities. 


Urban sustainability challenges are incredibly complex, broad, and interdisciplinary; I aim to showcase the diversity of urban ecosystems within my proposed
chapters. 

I approach these topics by integrating remote sensing, quantitative surveys, and innovative environmental engineering techniques at different scales and in different cities.

Previously, I worked as a research technician at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center. Specifically, I worked in the [Technology in Ecology Lab](https://serc.si.edu/labs/technology-in-ecology), designing technologically innovative climate change experiments and developing novel low-cost sensors to monitor diverse environmental phenomena. 

You can find the Technology in Ecology projects that I worked on [here](https://serc.si.edu/labs/technology-in-ecology/projects)!
