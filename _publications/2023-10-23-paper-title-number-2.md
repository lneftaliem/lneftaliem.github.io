title: "**[Breathing Life into Ghost Towns: Harnessing the Promise of â‚¬1 Homes]**(https://knight-hennessy.stanford.edu/news/breathing-life-ghost-towns-harnessing-promise-eu1-homes)"
excerpt: 'This article explores the paradox of affluent nations offering financial incentives to attract new residents while imposing stringent barriers on refugees seeking asylum. Drawing on my personal connection as the daughter of Eritrean immigrants, it underscores the inequities faced by refugees from East Africa and the Middle East. Ultimately, the piece calls for inclusive policies that harness the potential of migrant communities to address demographic and economic challenges.'
