[Breathing Life into Ghost Towns: Harnessing the Promise of €1 Homes](https://knight-hennessy.stanford.edu/news/breathing-life-ghost-towns-harnessing-promise-eu1-homes)

This article explores the paradox of affluent nations offering financial incentives to attract new residents while imposing stringent barriers on refugees seeking asylum. Drawing on my personal connection as the daughter of Eritrean immigrants, it underscores the inequities faced by refugees from East Africa and the Middle East. Ultimately, the piece calls for inclusive policies that harness the potential of migrant communities to address demographic and economic challenges.

Forests provide a critically-important nature-based tool to combat the climate crisis. This report addresses the U.S.’s opportunities to deploy climate-smart forestry practices to remove additional quantities of climate-harming carbon from the atmosphere. The report notes that the inability to reliably track and quantify carbon removals and other co-benefits from forestry practices is holding back wider adoption of such practices. It recommends specific steps that the Administration should take to advance the measurement, monitoring, verification and reporting of carbon removals and other benefits associated with climate-smart forestry practices. With the backing of solid measurement and monitoring, governmental authorities and private parties can more confidently incentivize climate-smart forestry practices through a variety of potential mechanisms such as conservation grants, procurement preferences, premium pricing for climate-smart forestry products and better functioning carbon markets. Prime forestry-related carbon removal opportunities in the U.S. include agroforestry, reforestation, urban forestry, improved forest management and long-lived wood products.
